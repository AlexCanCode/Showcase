\f0\fs24 \cf0 TO DO\
\
- Center project card divs\
- Add Project card icons \
- create project card pictures\
- add project card descriptions\
- figure out activity map\
- style contact icons\
- change out picture for more professional one \
- determine both light and dark theme color palettes (may put this on the back burner but need to keep in mind when determining color palette\
- tighten up language next to picture to be less generic and more eye catching (think of your story - and what makes you unique and hirable)\
- Fix footer color \
- Implement color palette\
- Create and implement mobile nav bar look for small screens\
- Hover on project cards is super wonky \
- reload on not the main page is incredibly funky - landing screen flashes quickly\
- get rid of resume given the exp section? Or let both speak for you? \
- Consider having nabber slide down with contents, may make second block less \'93intense\'94\
       - Would make the navbar smaller as well, condensing it when it reaches a point on downward scroll\
- adjust colors so nabber is not white on white in experience section (will live with for now)\

\
BUGS\
- IMPORTANT - Padding is not right on certain viewpoints \
- Adjust landing screen height for mobile as it does not currently take up whole page\
- box hover effect not working on project cards\
- Padding for theme toggle does not adjust when shrink is added to navber\
 - check for reload and load properly sized nav bar - so animation doesn\'92t happen on reload\
