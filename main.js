/*list of things needed:
- nav back to top button that follows page
- make grid and icons for portfolio
- choose color pallete
	- implement for headers and other things
- consider what font should be used (keep it basic, no more than two on the page)
- figure out d3 chart
	- link daily events to appear in tooltip when you hover over day
	- center chart
	- determine better name for chart
- light/dark theme button and styles (probably around the end and may require some refactoring of app)
	- also need to align properly (all the way to far right (have it duck under the menu on mobile))
- design the actual project card to look nice
- take pictures of projects and write descriptions
- footer
- get proper picture 
- consider if you really want button animation (perhaps make shorter)
- transition all styles over to the css sheet and clean up as needed
